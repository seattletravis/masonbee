Mason Bee Tracker — Django + PostgreSQL Project
A community‑driven platform for mapping Seattle‑area gardens, tracking mason bee habitats, and supporting ecological stewardship. This project blends data engineering, geospatial modeling, and privacy‑preserving design to create a tool that helps gardeners and educators support native pollinators.

Project Overview
Mason bees are highly efficient native pollinators, but their success depends on access to safe nesting sites and nearby forage. This project aims to:
- Map community gardens and green spaces in the Seattle region
- Allow users to register and manage mason bee houses
- Provide privacy‑preserving visibility into local pollinator activity
- Support educators, gardeners, and ecological volunteers
- Build a scalable, open‑source foundation for future expansion
This repository contains the full Django backend, PostgreSQL schema, and data‑import pipeline for garden datasets.
